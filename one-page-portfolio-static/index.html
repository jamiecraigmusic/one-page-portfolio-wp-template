      Here you are being responsible for yourself and seeking out support with whatever you are struggling with. That takes strength.  
      I hope you find relief from what ails you, whether it is with me, or somewhere else. You deserve it (even if you don’t feel like 
      you do)!</p>

      <p class="bio-text"> I have worked in many different fields, but none of them truly resonated with my soul. 
        For a while I was uncertain of my purpose, but the answer was right in front of my face, as friends and family always came to me 
        to talk about their problems. I loved exploring solutions with the and “You are so understanding and easy to talk too” was 
        something I often heard. I also always had an intense interest in psychology, trying to understand why people do what they do 
        and how they can change their behaviors to healthier ones. So I went back to school and received my bachelor’s degree 
        in Social Psychology and started working in an addiction treatment center in 2001. This work just felt right for me, and 
        I earned a Master of Social Work degree to be of better service to people in need.  In 2013, I became a 
        Licensed Clinical Social Worker by the state of Florida and currently have a private practice in Delray Beach, FL. 
        I still do some work with a dual diagnosis treatment center running group therapy, and I also teach a few classes at 
        Florida Atlantic University. The field of psychology is constantly evolving and I remain fascinated with learning new techniques 
        that can help clients heal. Read below for more information on my practice. </p>

    <div class="service-text">
      <p class="service-description">Many studies have shown that one of the best benefits of therapy is talking.  So, we start with that. Allowing a person to be in a judgement free zone to just unload whatever is bothering them can remove so much emotional weight and often brings some relief. I also tend to incorporate a lot of education in my sessions, as I am a teacher by nature, and believe knowledge is invaluable to solving problems. But I have been trained in many other therapeutic techniques.  Here are just some:</p>

        <h4 class="numbers">01</h4>
        <h3 class="therapy-title">Mindfulness</h3>
        <p class="therapy-description">One of my favorites!  This is where I will teach you ways to become present in the here and now.  Through different forms of meditation, you will learn the skill of not being so distracted by random intrusive thoughts.  This can be invaluable as many of our struggles originate from being worried about the future, or pondering the past.  Research has shown this to be a very effective technique to address anxiety, depression, trauma, addictions, physical issues, and sleep problems.  </p>

      <div class="col-md-6 therapy-type">
        <h4 class="numbers">02</h4>
        <h3 class="therapy-title">Post Induction Therapy</h3>
        <p class="therapy-description">This is a form of trauma therapy which addresses major traumas and relational trauma.  Generally, we would look at your childhood and identify different forms of trauma which impact how to react today to life’s challenges.  Inner child work is incorporated in this form of therapy.  Codependency is also addressed in this form of therapy.</p>

        <h4 class="numbers">03</h4>
        <h3 class="therapy-title">Acceptance and Commitment Therapy</h3>
        <p class="therapy-description">In this therapy, we would help you to identify what you value in life, and explore ways to commit and take action to accomplish them despite uncomfortable feels.  Exercises we will do are designed to separate you from strong emotions and can make life more manageable.  Greater psychological flexibility is the goal of ACT. </p>

      <div class="col-md-6 therapy-type">
        <h4 class="numbers">04</h4>
        <h3 class="therapy-title">Cognitive Behavioral Therapy</h3>
        <p class="therapy-description">This therapy starts off by identifying the types of unhealthy thinking which may lead you to uncomfortable emotions disproportionate to the situation. New and healthier thinking is learned, and many people find relief from anxiety, depression, and other conditions.

        <p class="expect-text">We will start off getting to know each other and exploring what brings you to see me. We will decide on a plan to get you feeling better,  with goals, and decide on how to work towards them.  I partner with you to figure out what changes need to be made, this is a team effort. My sessions last 50 minutes and usually we will meet weekly for a while, to get a handle on whatever is going on. Then sessions will become farther apart as your symptoms are alleviated.  If the need arises again, sessions can always be started up again. Sometimes all the work is done in sessions, and sometimes tasks will be given to work on between sessions.  In special circumstances I can also do “intensives” which are all day sessions to address trauma.</p>

        <p class="expect-text">My cost is $150/session and I am in network with Aetna, United Healthcare, and Cigna.  All intake paperwork is completed online, and I have a billing company that manages insurance and payments. </p>
